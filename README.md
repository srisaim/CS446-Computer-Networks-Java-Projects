# CS446 Computer Network & Internetworking Projects
Introduction to Internetworking:

CS446 is structured to create a practical understanding of computer networks with a special focus on the Internet. The course aimed to teach theoretical concepts with real-world network applications, making it ideal for students who are interested in how the complex world of online communication works.


# Course Structure and Content

Introduction to the Internet:
  - The course begins with an exploratory overview of the Internet, introducing students to its foundational structure and components. This includes understanding how different networks come together to form the global Internet.
    
Protocol Layers:
  - An in-depth look at the protocol layers that make up the Internet. This includes understanding the OSI model, focusing on how each layer contributes to the network's functionality.

Edge and Core Networks:
  - Delves into the distinctions between edge networks (the part of the network to which devices like computers and smartphones connect) and core networks (the central part of the telecommunication network).

Access Networks and Physical Media:
  - Covers different types of access networks (such as DSL, Fiber, 5G) and the physical media they use. This section emphasizes the diversity and range of technologies enabling Internet access.

Application Layer:
  - Focuses on the top layer of the network stack, exploring how applications use the network. Topics include web technologies, DNS, email protocols, and more.

Transport Layer:
  - Examines the mechanisms for data transfer across the network. Key topics include TCP/UDP protocols, congestion control, and error handling.

Network Layer:
  - Discusses routing and forwarding of data in the network. This includes understanding IP addresses, routing algorithms, and data packet movement.

Overall Learning Perspective:
  - Gain a comprehensive understanding of how the Internet works from a technological standpoint.
  - Develop the ability to analyze and design network protocols and applications.
- Acquire practical skills applicable to networking careers, including troubleshooting and optimizing network performance.

In our increasingly connected world, a solid grasp of network fundamentals is crucial, not only for the networking professionals, but for anyone in the technology field. This course lays the groundwork for advanced study and careers in network design, cybersecurity, and IT infrastructure.
